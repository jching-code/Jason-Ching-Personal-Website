            <h2>Biomechanics Material Properties Analyzer (MATLAB)</h2>
            <p>Description: In biomechanical analysis, we utilize both destructive and non-destructive testing methods to assess values such as stress, strain, stiffness, and friction. These measurements are derived from key input values collected during testing: applied force, cross-sectional area, and change in distance. Additionally, we create visual representations, such as the stress-strain curve and stiffness curve, to enhance data analysis.</p>
            <p>Purpose of this project: The overarching goal of this project is to optimize the efficiency of material property calculations and graph the obtained data based on a comprehensive set of input values. By enhancing the efficiency of biomechanical analysis, this project aims to have practical applications in real-life scenarios involving the human body. It can be employed to study and understand the behavior of elements like bones, muscle tissue, and other deformable objects under varying stress conditions.</p>

        <div class="description-content">
            <h2>Area of a polygon (MATLAB)</h2>
            <p>Description: In this project, the user must put in two inputs: the number of sides (numSides) and the length of each side (sidelength). The code first finds the perimeter of the polygon using the side lengths and number of sides. The code then finds the apothem using both inputs. Lastly, the code finds the area by multiplying the perimeter to the apthem and dividing the product by 2. If the area is impossible to calculate with the given inputs, the code will print the phrase "Invalid Format" and the user is allowed to give different input values.</p>
            <p>Purpose of this project: The motivation behind this project stems from the extensive utilization of polygons in computer graphics, particularly in the creation of 3D shapes for animation and video games. To achieve a 3D structure, mutiple 2D polygons are interconnected at various angles. In summary, this project aims to create a robust and adaptable function capable of handling diverse polygon descriptions, validating their format, and providing accurate area calculations when appropriate. </p>

            <h2> Supervised Machine Learning Chat Bot</h2>
            <p>Description: My python code implements a simple chatbot using a knowledge base stored in a JSON file. The functions used in the code reads the knowledge base from the JSON file, saves modifications back to the JSON file, and finds the best matching answer to the question asked. The purpose of this code is to create a basic chatbot that learns and improves over time by allowing users to provide new answers for unrecognized questions. The chatbot leverages the knowledge base in the JSON file and employs a matching approach to find the closest question to the user's input. If a match is found, the corresponding answer is provided. If not, the bot requests the user to contribute a new answer, which is then added to the knowledge base for future interactions. This iterative learning process allows the chatbot to enhance its capabilities based on user input.
            </p>
            <p>Purpose of this project: Machine learning plays a pivotal role in both online environments and real-life applications, exerting a profound influence that extends to optimizing various aspects of our daily lives. By harnessing and processing vast sets of data, machine learning algorithms have the capacity to transform the way we approach problems, make decisions, and enhance overall efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Text to Speech Chat Bot</h2>
            <p>Description: The code created is an interactive voice-based assistant that responds to user input with various actions. It demonstrates the integration of speech recognition and synthesis technologies to enable a dynamic interaction between the user and the computer. The code showcases practical applications such as playing YouTube videos, conducting searches, and providing humorous responses. While the current implementation serves more as a playful demonstration, the underlying structure can be extended to create a more sophisticated voice assistant tailored for specific tasks, commands, or applications. The code serves as a starting point for exploring voice-driven interactions and highlights the potential of using speech technologies in Python programming. </p>
            <p>Purpose of this project: Artificial intelligences like Siri have become integral parts of our daily lives, showcasing their utility beyond mere vocal interactions. While some AIs may operate silently, their diverse applications make them indispensable. Looking forward, the future holds the promise of even broader integration, especially in emerging technologies such as self-driving cars, where AI is poised to revolutionize our everyday experiences.</p>

        <div class="description-content">
            <h2>Cell Culture (Intro to Biomedical Engineering)</h2>
            <p>Description: In Biochemical Engineering (A branch in Biomedical Engineering), we worked with sterile cell culture to perform assays that
                measure pharmacodynamic outputs in living cells. In the first week of lab, we built our baseline
                skills to perform cell culture and analysis steps by covering pipetting, serial dilution, and
                colorimetric analysis. In later weeks of lab, we worked with presto
                blue, which is metabolize by living cells to a pink product. This process of lab occurs in visible
                and fluorescent wavelengths that allow for the assessment of relative cell viability in a IC50
                assay. </p>
            <p>Purpose of this project: To gain a hands-on experience in cell culture techniques, cell counting methodologies, and the assessment of cytotoxic drug effects on cellular viability. This knowledge is fundemental for reseachers and professors in pharmacology and cancer biology. </p>

            <h2> 3D Printing (Academics and Hobby) </h2>
            <p>Description: 3D printers use a manufacturing process known as fused deposition
                modeling, which extrudes a thermoplastic filament through a hot nozzle. The melted filament is
                built layer by layer in order to create a final 3D printed product. The file that the printer
                uses is created in a “slicing” software that converts the design into a gcode file. A gcode file gives data that the 3D printer understands to complete the printing task.</p>
            <p>Purpose of this project: 3D printing is a pivotal aspect of engineering, serving as both a hobby and a significant contributor to job opportunities and academic pursuits. In a practical example, the image to the left showcases 3D printed dog bones, demonstrating its application in testing biomechanical material properties such as stress and strain.</p>

            <h2>DCS Computer Podium (Work Experience)</h2>
            <p>Description: During the summer of 2023, I worked as a Student Audio and Visual Technician, focusing on the contruction of new computer podiums and the enchancement of existing computer podiums utilized in Rutger's classrooms. 

                Transitioning into the fall and spring semesters, I work the role of a Support Specialist. In this capacity, I am tasked with troubleshooting and resolving technical issues that arose during class time. This involved quickly and effectively addressing problems to minimize disruptions to the learning environment. </p>
            <p>Purpose of this project: The image to the left shows a computer podium that the build team and I created for Beck Auditorium at Rutgers University.</p>
