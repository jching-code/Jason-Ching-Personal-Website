            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Jason Ching, a Biomedical Engineering student at Rutgers University. Currently pursuing my degree, I specialize in technical skills such as Matlab, HTML, CSS, and Python.
                <br>
                <br>
                My academic focus lies in Biomechanics and bioelectrical engineering, where I'm exploring the application of technology to the medical field. In addition to my coursework, I'm actively engaged in hands-on projects, including Material Properties and Cell Culture. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of academics, my interests extend to AI and machine learning. I'm passionate about leveraging these technologies to address complex challenges and enhance problem-solving capabilities. This interest has led me to explore projects and stay updated on the latest developments in the field.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alongside my academic journey, I've gained practical experience in various industries, including information technology, retail, and the unique environment of a summer camp. These experiences have honed my skills in problem-solving and adaptability.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I continue my studies, I'm excited to further explore the intersection of technology and healthcare, particularly in the realm of AI and machine learning applications. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and experiences.

            <h2>Why I chose Biomedical Engineering:</h2>
            <p>
                My journey to Biomedical Engineering (BME) began in high school, where I delved into AP Biology, AP Calculus, and AP Physics. During this period, my fascination with biology was sparked by specific topics, notably protein synthesis. As someone who frequented the gym, understanding the intricacies of protein became more than just academic; it became a practical and personal interest.
                <br>
                <br>
                Calculus quickly emerged as a favorite, providing me with a deep appreciation for its logical connections and cohesive nature. Physics, especially in the context of kinematics, allowed me to bridge concepts to mathematics, creating a comprehensive understanding of STEM subjects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although I enjoyed biology, math, and physics individually, the prospect of limiting myself to just one discipline didn't resonate with me. After thoughtful consideration and guidance from my AP biology teacher, I discovered the interdisciplinary world of biomedical engineering.
                <br>
                <br>
                This major not only accommodated my diverse interests but also aligned with my aspirations to contribute to the medical field. The realization solidified during my volunteering stint at Centrastate Medical Center in Freehold, where I witnessed the impact of technology on healthcare.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, as I reflect on my journey, it's evident that biomedical engineering is not just a major but a path I'm committed to exploring and dedicating my career to. The amalgamation of biology, mathematics, physics, and a direct impact on healthcare resonates deeply with my professional aspirations.
